#C14: Pro-Portfolio

##Like C2, but better!

###Info:
This challenge will be a rework of challenge 2, where it will serve as the basis of my newfound career by showing interested parties what I can do. The difference being that this time it will be created using React, whereas C2 was bare bones.

One purpose of this project is show that I have an understanding of the basics in HTML and CSS. Any Javascript or features beside those two are a plus. This project is also to help me learn of other tools that can be used via research.

The other is to showcase what I have in terms of skills and how far I've come in the field throughout the course as a person. It will be an ever changing portfolio to show interested parties what I am or can be capable of.
